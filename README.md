# fluka2lhe
This repo uses fluka as a generator for photonuclear interactions. It provides input cards and user routines to simulate and dump photonuclear interactions including phi to K+ K- and phi to K long K short. It provides a wrapper for running fluka on a cluster. It provides scripts for processing fluka userdump files into feather and LHE files.
